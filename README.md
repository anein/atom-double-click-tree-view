# double-click-tree-view package for atom editor

By default, the atom tree-view for browsing files/directories will open a file or collapse / expand
a directory listing just by single-clicking on the entry.

This package forces the user to double click on a file to open it, or on a directory to expand/collapse it. This effectively turns a single-click into just selecting the item clicked on, which is the default behavior in most editors.

To install:

```apm install double-click-tree-view```


Big thanks to h2so5 for writing the original chary-tree-view that this has been forked from.

## Update:

Added a new option to disable double click on directories.
